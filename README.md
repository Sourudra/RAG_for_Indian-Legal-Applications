# RAG_for_Indian-Legal-Applications
This repository contains the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored for answering legal questions based on Indian law. By integrating semantic retrieval with advanced natural language generation (NLG), the project delivers accurate, context-aware responses to legal queries.

# Features
Semantic Search: Utilizes FAISS for efficient retrieval of relevant legal contexts from datasets like the Indian Constitution, CrPC, and IPC.
Natural Language Generation: Employs Flan-T5 to generate human-like, grounded answers based on retrieved context and user queries.
Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, deduplication, and standardization for high-quality, consistent input.
Scalable Design: Modular architecture for easy integration with additional datasets or functionality enhancements.

# Data Preparation:

Load and clean datasets covering the Indian Constitution, IPC, and CrPC.
Generate 768-dimensional embeddings using Sentence-BERT (all-mpnet-base-v2) for semantic similarity.
# Context Retrieval:

Build a FAISS index for fast and accurate similarity searches.
Retrieve the most relevant legal entries based on the user query.
# Answer Generation:

Combine the query and retrieved context.
Use the Flan-T5-base model to generate a concise, contextually accurate response.
# Response Output:

Display the generated answer, anchored in retrieved legal knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and fluency.
